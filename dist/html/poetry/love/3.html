<p>3.</p><p>We walked along the sidewalk in the middle of the fall,<br/>our fingers sometimes locking together as they fleetingly brushed.<br/>Mostly they hid in the corners of our arms,<br/>trying to get (and then stay) warm.</p><p>Which one of us wanted to walk?<br/>I don't remember, and I don't care.<br/>I was with you, and that made me glad,<br/>even though I totally caught a cold, and you know it.</p><p>You pointed to a tree.<br/>I thought you were sad because of the dying leaves,<br/>but you pointed out a squirrel couple chasing each other around the branches,<br/>and you said that in a way that made you seem happy.</p><p>Maybe it was silly of me to think I could tell you to do anything,<br/>but I was certain that,<br/>if you didn't kiss me right then,<br/>my heart would melt.</p><br/><p><a ui-sref="poetry.name({ series: 'love', number: '4' })">next Â»</a></p>
