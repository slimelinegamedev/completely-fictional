It is the work of creators, issued from a real <br/>necessity in the author, produced for himself. It expresses <br/>the knowledge of a supreme egoism, in which laws wither away.</p><p>Every page must explode, either by profound heavy <br/>seriousness, the whirlwind, poetic frenzy, the new, the <br/>eternal, the crushing joke, enthusiasm for principles, or by <br/>the way in which it is printed. On the one hand a tottering <br/>world in flight, betrothed to the glockenspiel of hell, on <br/>the other hand: new men. Rough, bouncing, riding on hiccups. <br/>Behind them a crippled world and literary quacks with a mania <br/>for improvement.</p><p>(<a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jenglish/English104/tzara.html">source</a>)</p><br/><p><a href="/poetry/plagiarised-11">next »</a></p></div>
