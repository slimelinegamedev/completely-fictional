Literally one line earlier, in fact.</p><p>According to Oberst, there’s nothing ambitious or noteworthy about his album; it’s a “record of our failures” as he puns in “Method Acting “. Either way he goes about it, whether he’s crushed by the incomprehensible and inexorably advancing “Big Picture” or spurred on entirely by self-gratification and self-love, he’s an ignorant and ineffectual lemming. Even though “the picture is far too big to look at” he still can’t cut himself some slack.</p><p>Oberst – or whatever persona Oberst is affecting here, since it seems to change with every record – asks a question at the beginning of “The Big Picture”: “It seems like it, right? Don’t you think?” We don’t know why he’s asking the question, and his friends or bandmates or whoever is accompanying him don’t answer, instead focusing either on the hopeless task of stumbling through the city in the vain hope of finding wherever it is they’re supposed to go (<em>I wonder if this is a metaphor for something…</em>), or on the singing, nihilistic Oberst that’s playing over the radio. “Shh, shh, I love this song,” the woman says, and then hums along with the tune.</p><p>It’s Bright Eyes singing to Bright Eyes, and sans the soundscape framing device it’s a version of the song that only Bright Eyes would ever hear. Oberst’s question, his one attempt at breaking out of this solipsistic loop, at finding an opinion and a viewpoint outside of himself, is completely ignored.</p></div>
