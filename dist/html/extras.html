My greatest accomplishment to date is failing miserably at doing a Kickstarter.</p><p>Fun fact: I used to be in the Army National Guard, specifically a <a href="http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/arts-and-media/public-affairs-specialist.html">public affairs specialist</a>.</p><p>When I was in training for my Army job, one of my instructors said that inside every novelist is a cheap philosopher. It's true. (Also, this next paragraph has a lot of 'I's in it.)</p><p>I like writing all kinds of things, especially stories and essays. I'm very conversational and self-deprecating; I like making people smile, and I try to say familiar things in new ways. I try to be positive a lot, but a lot of times I get really angry instead because there are a lot of awful things in the world and it's impossible for me to fix even a small portion of them. As a result, I try to end everything I write with either "Everything will be alright" or "I hope you have a wonderful life," because it makes me smile and I hope it'll make you smile too.</p><p>I love the semicolon; however, my love is unrequited. I find solace — however fleeting — in the arms of the hyphen.</p><p>*<a ui-sref="extraPlaces({name:'write-her-a-thank-you-note'})">smiles</a> for the non-existent <a ui-sref="extraPlaces({name:'falling-onto-a-hot-griddle'})">camera</a>*</p></div>
