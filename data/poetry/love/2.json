"<p>2.</p><p>We leaned into each other on a shitty sofa,<br/>our arms tangled together in wayward places.<br/>We were in our favorite sweats, munching candy and popcorn,<br/>watching old movies all night.</p><p>We kept everything dark,<br/>and the light from the TV glowed on your beautiful face.<br/>I wanted to kiss you,<br/>but you were so entranced.</p><p>It was around midnight, and you had chosen something I loved,<br/>simply because of how wonderful you were.<br/>I wanted to return the favor,<br/>but all we had left were movies for me.</p><p>The movie ended and I said I was tired.<br/>I'd told you before I wanted to stay up all night,<br/>and I was lying right now, because I could.</p><p>You followed me to bed,<br/>and I spent hours watching you sleep,<br/>your fingers, interlaced with mine,<br/>gripping my arm close.</p>"
