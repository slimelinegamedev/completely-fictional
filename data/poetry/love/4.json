"<p>4.</p><p>We rested beneath the willow tree,<br/>you and I,<br/>and I noticed the daisies in your hands.<br/>One by one, you would pick the petals:<br/>Pick. “He loves me.” Pick. “He loves me not.”<br/>Over and over again.<br/>Yeah, only an idiot would fail to<br/>see just what you meant.</p><p>So as I sat absorbed in my journal,<br/>writing something beautiful and<br/>loaded with meaning that I could<br/>give to you at some later date,<br/>you suddenly stood up, the daisypetals flying everywhere, and you<br/>reached your hand out for me to <br/>grab. I stared at you for a moment,<br/>confused, and so you yanked me <br/>to my feet, the loose pages in my <br/>journal flying everywhere, and it<br/>only took a moment for me to realize<br/>what it means to put yourself before<br/>others.</p><p>I don't remember what happened next.<br/>All I remember is the look in your eyes<br/>as that moment stopped itself from <br/>fading in mine</p><p>and you realized it too.</p>"
