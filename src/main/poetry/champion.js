      Not quite a colossus<br/>
      Not yet a champion<br/>
      Not for a lack or wont of try<br/>
      Not for nothing, never for much<br/>
      Never for sure, and always as such<br/>
      But for sure I tried<br/>
      For sure I stood on the shoulders<br/>
      Of the few giants I knew<br/>
      And hoped their height would blend into my own<br/>
      But I never saw further<br/>
      Than my own navel<br/>
      Though some enjoyed my transcription of the view<br/>
      A few transfixed on my gaze<br/>
      And in set malaise<br/>
      An inset daze<br/>
      A stuttering phase<br/>
      A doddering pace<br/>
      While everyone raced<br/>
      through the maze<br/>
      I munched on maize<br/>
      which is corn.<br/>
      It was tasty, and it was yellow<br/>
      just like me.<br/>
      You see,<br/>
      I have had some success<br/>
      Not enough to lay claim as the best<br/>
      Not even enough to lay claim as the worst<br/>
      But a figure big enough to figure I’m doing something<br/>
      right.<br/>
      Maybe.<br/>
      But what a sight<br/>
      lately<br/>
      I am.<br/>
      I allow myself to walk into the night<br/>
      Stately<br/>
      I am.<br/>
      I find myself grateful for the night<br/>
      Greatly<br/>
      I am.<br/>
      I even try to blend into the night<br/>
      Terribly<br/>
      It is day.<br/>
      And when it is day the sun shines.<br/>
      And when the sun shines the birds sing<br/>
      And when the birds sing I try to join in<br/>
      in my own little awkward way<br/>
      Because the musicality of things appeals to me<br/>
      The song-like, dream-like flow<br/>
      of anything<br/>
      Through this and that and the other thing<br/>
      into something<br/>
      new?<br/>
      perhaps<br/>
      something that hasn’t been though of or up<br/>
      in a very long time<br/>
      perhaps<br/>
      when I think enough<br/>
      my thoughts will blend together<br/>
      and out of the slurry<br/>
      I’ll bric-o-brac a newness<br/>
      and on this newness I’ll stand<br/>
      not quite a colossus<br/>
      not yet a champion<br/>
      <del>but happy nonetheless</del><br/>
      but notwithstanding happy.
