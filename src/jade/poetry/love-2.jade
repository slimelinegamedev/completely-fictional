    | We leaned into each other on a shitty sofa,
    br
    | our arms tangled together in wayward places.
    br
    | We were in our favorite sweats, munching candy and popcorn,
    br
    | watching old movies all night.
  p
    | We kept everything dark,
    br
    | and the light from the TV glowed on your beautiful face.
    br
    | I wanted to kiss you,
    br
    | but you were so entranced.
  p
    | It was around midnight, and you had chosen something I loved,
    br
    | simply because of how wonderful you were.
    br
    | I wanted to return the favor,
    br
    | but all we had left were movies for me.
  p
    | The movie ended and I said I was tired.
    br
    | I'd told you before I wanted to stay up all night,
    br
    | and I was lying right now, because I could.
  p
    | You followed me to bed,
    br
    | and I spent hours watching you sleep,
    br
    | your fingers, interlaced with mine,
    br
    | gripping my arm close.
