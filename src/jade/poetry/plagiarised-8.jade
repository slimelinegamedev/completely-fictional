  p VIII.
  p
    | A ten year old boy
    br
    | Up on an altar
    br
    | Dressed like a Pope
    br
    | Reads from a scripture:
  p
    | Oh Mighty Elvis
    br
    | If you can hear us
    br
    | Please appear
  p
    | And out from this side closet in the sanctuary
    br
    | Come Gold-Plated Elvis
    br
    | With a garbage bag over his head 
    br
    | and a black cape
  p
    | He walks really slowly
    br
    | And you can tell he's decaying
    br
    | And when he turns to face the old women
    br
    | They all go "Oooooooh"
  p
    | The little boy turns the page 
    br
    | And I can see the paragraph 
    br
    | And it says
  p
    | Oh Mighty Elvis
    br
    | If you can hear us
    br
    | Shake your hips now
    br
    | Give us a sign
  p
    | And all of a sudden Elvis starts shaking his hips
    br
    | And all of the old women take out
    br
    | and put onto the tables
    br
    | these replica gold Elvis...
