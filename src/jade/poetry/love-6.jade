    | We talked over the phone for a while
    br
    | Every now and again we needed something familiar
    br
    | and I guess we supposed that we'd do
  p
    | Eventually, you realized that we were making a mistake
    br
    | and you stopped answering my calls
    br
    | I kept calling.
  p
    | I grew accustomed to the familiar beep
    br
    | of your answering machine
    br
    | I didn't know if you even listened to my messages
  p and I didn't care.
