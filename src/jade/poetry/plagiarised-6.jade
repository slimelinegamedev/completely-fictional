    | I stood out there for a few minutes, 
    br
    | listening to the far away drone of the freeway
    br
    | and the occasional song of a bird. 
    br
    | Flowers are starting to bloom, 
    br
    | and I could smell...
    br
    | jasmine,
    br
    | and cut grass.
  p
    | I’ll miss my pets 
    br
    | and my house 
    br
    | and this perfect weather, 
    br
    | but it is a small price to pay 
    br
    | to be in one of my favorite cities in the world, 
    br
    | working with people I love, 
    br
    | on a show that I'm intensely proud to be part of.
