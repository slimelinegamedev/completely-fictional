  h1 Let's call this a "potpourri" of extras because that seems like a fun thing to do

    li
      | I wrote a short story based on Kimbra lyrics and I called it, uh, 
      a(class="extras", ui-sref="extras.places({name:'kimbra'})") Kimbra

      | This is an 
      a(class="extras", ui-sref="extras.places({name:'cool-places'})") image list of cool places I like
      |  inspired by John Campbell's old image list of webcomics he liked.

      | Did you know I love to take photos? And that I've been paid to do it? 
      a(class="extras", href='http://zackschuster.carbonmade.com') Here's my portfolio.

      | I made a

      |  to JDA Winslow. Stand in awe.
  h1(style='padding-top:2em;') Here's a bit more about me, Zack Schuster
  p
    | I'm a 24-year-old dude from The Midwest who sometimes moonlights as a dead prussian general. My greatest accomplishment to date is failing miserably at doing a Kickstarter.
  p
    | Fun fact: I used to be in the Army National Guard, specifically a 
    a(href='http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/arts-and-media/public-affairs-specialist.html') public affairs specialist
    | .

    | When I was in training for my Army job, one of my instructors said that inside every novelist is a cheap philosopher. It's true. (Also, this next paragraph has a lot of 'I's in it.)
  p
    | I like writing all kinds of things, especially stories and essays. I'm very conversational and self-deprecating; I like making people smile, and I try to say familiar things in new ways. I try to be positive a lot, but a lot of times I get really angry instead because there are a lot of awful things in the world and it's impossible for me to fix even a small portion of them. As a result, I try to end everything I write with either "Everything will be alright" or "I hope you have a wonderful life," because it makes me smile and I hope it'll make you smile too.
  p
    | I love the semicolon; however, my love is unrequited. I find solace — however fleeting — in the arms of the hyphen.
