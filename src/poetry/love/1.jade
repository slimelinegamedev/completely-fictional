  | We fell in love over candlelight
  br
  | as nightingales, chirping softly through the open window,
  br
  | lounged lazily in the green veranda
  br
  | where young lovers shivered close in the almost-dark.
p
  | "Come with me," you said.
  br
  | I was certain you wanted to follow the nightingales
  br
  | Ever so slightly, I resisted your hand pulling mine
  br
  | You took it as an invitation.
p
  | I forget who paid the bill
  br
  | I remember I was the one who left the tip
  br
  | You didn't seem to care how much anything cost
  br
  | You kept staring into my eyes.
