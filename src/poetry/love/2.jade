  | We leaned into each other on a shitty sofa,
  br
  | our arms tangled together in wayward places.
  br
  | We were in our favorite sweats, munching candy and popcorn,
  br
  | watching old movies all night.
p
  | We kept everything dark,
  br
  | and the light from the TV glowed on your beautiful face.
  br
  | I wanted to kiss you,
  br
  | but you were so entranced.
p
  | It was around midnight, and you had chosen something I loved,
  br
  | simply because of how wonderful you were.
  br
  | I wanted to return the favor,
  br
  | but all we had left were movies for me.
p
  | The movie ended and I said I was tired.
  br
  | I'd told you before I wanted to stay up all night,
  br
  | and I was lying right now, because I could.
p
  | You followed me to bed,
  br
  | and I spent hours watching you sleep,
  br
  | your fingers, interlaced with mine,
  br
  | gripping my arm close.
