p VIII.
p
  | A ten year old boy
  br
  | Up on an altar
  br
  | Dressed like a Pope
  br
  | Reads from a scripture:
p
  | Oh Mighty Elvis
  br
  | If you can hear us
  br
  | Please appear
p
  | And out from this side closet in the sanctuary
  br
  | Come Gold-Plated Elvis
  br
  | With a garbage bag over his head 
  br
  | and a black cape
p
  | He walks really slowly
  br
  | And you can tell he's decaying
  br
  | And when he turns to face the old women
  br
  | They all go "Oooooooh"
p
  | The little boy turns the page 
  br
  | And I can see the paragraph 
  br
  | And it says
p
  | Oh Mighty Elvis
  br
  | If you can hear us
  br
  | Shake your hips now
  br
  | Give us a sign
p
  | And all of a sudden Elvis starts shaking his hips
  br
  | And all of the old women take out
  br
  | and put onto the tables
  br
  | these replica gold Elvis...
